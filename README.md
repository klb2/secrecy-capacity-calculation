# Calculation of the Secrecy Capacity

This repository contains Python implementations of two algorithms that allow a
(numerical) calculation of the secrecy capacity of wiretap channels.

The two algorithms are taken from the following publications:

> Secrecy Rates in Gaussian MIMO Wiretap Channels," IEEE Trans. Commun., vol.
> 63, no. 6, pp. 2288â€“2299, Jun.
> 2015.](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2424235)

> Algorithm for Achieving Secrecy Capacity in MIMO Wiretap Channels," in ICC

> 2020.](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9149178)



## Installation
You can install the package via pip
```bash
pip install secrecy-capacity
```

If you want to install the latest version, you can install the
package from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/klb2/secrecy-capacity-calculation.git
cd secrecy_capacity
git checkout dev  # only if you want to unstable version
pip install .
```


## Usage
Some examples are provided in the `examples/` directory.
You can run the code locally or using a service like Binder. If you use Binder,
you do not need a local Python installation and you can simply run the scripts
in your browser.
